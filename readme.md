# Pytimer

## Pytimer is a customizable timer application.

### Description :
Pytimer lets you create and manage multiple timers, each of which can trigger notifications. You can customize the message and duration of notifications, so that timers ring repeatedly when needed. Once activated, each timer displays not only the time remaining, but also the time at which it should end.
